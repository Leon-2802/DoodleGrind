# DoodleGrind
### Work in progress
This application should help you improve your drawing habit
- It gives a notification once per day to remind you of your daily drawing habit
- After opening the app you can generate an inspiration containing 3 random words from the WordNet library, if this isn`t enough you can let an AI (Cohere) generate you a detailed idea matching the provided words
- You type the object/topic your drawing is about into a field and start your task
- When you finished the drawing you can adjust the object/topic, rate your satisfaction with the result and upload a picture of your drawing
- The app keeps track of your past drawings, sorted by months
- Additionally some statistics will be recorded, like time spent drawing, streaks and satisfaction scores
